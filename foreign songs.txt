You have been Loved
Still Got the Blues
I put a spell on you
The singer sing
Scream
Jacques Loussier Trio 
My funny Valentines
In the air tonight
Just Blues
Careful
Morning of the Carnival
Hotel California
Night train
Long after you
On the road again
My little angel
Angel eyes
Another day in paradise
Colour to rhe moon
The tennezee waltz
Ain't no Sunshine
Love song
